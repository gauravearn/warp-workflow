# warp-workflow
I implemented the in-built array addition to build this warp workflow. This is a warp workflow builder which uses the shell in built  array addition and adds your commands to the in-built array  declaration. Instead of echo, i called the ```C printf``` to add better syntax declaration. Have multiple commands no need to worry, it will take care of everything.

I skipped the argument section as that you can add according to your needs.
