# warp_workflow_builder
I implemented the in-built array addition to build this warp workflow. This is a warp workflow builder which uses the shell in built  array addition and adds your commands to the in-built array  declaration. Instead of echo, i called the ```C printf``` to add better syntax declaration. Have multiple commands no need to worry, it will take care of everything.

I skipped the argument section as that you can add according to your needs. I am pushing a ruby or a crystal class for this, that will have the class feature on initialization, if you want to do this in shell, you can add one iteration, let me know if you want me to add.
