# warp_workflow_builder
I implemented the in-built array addition to build this warpworkflow. This is a warp workflow builder which uses the shell in built  array addition and adds your commands to the in-built array  declaration. Instead of echo, i called the ```C printf``` to add better syntax declaration.
